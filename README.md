This project is the official Frontend codebase of [kodilan.com](https://kodilan.com) which is a software related job board for Turkey.

### Tech Stack

This project based on [Vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) stack and uses [Vuex](https://github.com/vuejs/vuex), [Vue Router](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-router) and [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli).

#### Ajax Requests
To handle AJAX requests, we use [axios](https://github.com/axios/axios). The data we fetch from the server will unlikely change during a user session, so we cache responses using an Axios Middleware called [axios-extensions](https://github.com/kuitos/axios-extensions). This makes our app blazingly fast in between page changes. For the best user experience, we also [maintain the scroll position](https://gitlab.com/kodilan/frontend/blob/master/src/router/index.js#L93-95) between pages changes, thanks to [Vue Router's Scroll Behavior](https://router.vuejs.org/guide/advanced/scroll-behavior.html) feature.

#### SEO
Since [kodilan.com](https://kodilan.com) is a Single Page Application job posting board, SEO plays a very critical role in our organic growth. To generate dynamic page title, keywords, meta tags and Open Graph tags, we use [vue-meta](https://github.com/nuxt/vue-meta) from Nuxt team. On top of that, we use [Prerender.io](https://prerender.io) to serve SEO friendly HTML to search engines.

### Running project locally

We use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) as our package manager and you should have yarn installed on your machine to be able to run this project locally. After that you can run the following commands in order.
